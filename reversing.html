<h1><center> Reversing Arthritis </center></h1>
<br>
<div class="b"><p>There are over 100 different types of arthritis, from rheumatoid to osteoarthritis, 
    to psoriatic, and gout. The two most prevalent types are rheumatoid and osteoarthritis. 
    Arthritis is a broad term for ailments that affect joints and the tissues that surround them. 
    Most types of arthritis either fall into one of two categories: degenerative arthritis (like osteoarthritis) or inflammatory arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis). 
    These typically occur in areas such as the hips, knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows and wrists.
    Although we have heard that arthritis is just something that we have to deal with as we age, there is good news. 
    Many types of arthritis can be treated by regenerative medicine, allowing for better functionality of the joint and reduced pain symptoms.</p></div>
