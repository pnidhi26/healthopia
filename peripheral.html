<div class="b"><p>Nerve regeneration includes regrowth of injured axons as well as myelination, 
    restoration of synaptic connections and recovery of physiological functions. 
    Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is prepared from the patient's own blood and contains growth factors that influence wound healing and used in various surgical fields including oral and maxillofacial surgery. 
    When platelets are activated either ex vivo or in vivo, growth factors and proteins were released from platelets' alpha granules. Recent studies proved that PRP could promote regeneration of injured peripheral nerve.Â </p></div>
