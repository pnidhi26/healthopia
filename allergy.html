<div class="b"><h3>What exactly is an allergy?</h3></div>
<div class="b"><p>An allergy is an abnormal, adverse physical reaction of the body to certain substances known as allergens or antigens, which may not affect other individuals. The body’s immune system mistakenly identifies these substances as dangerous invaders and activates antibodies to defend itself. In Chinese medicine, this reaction disrupts the energy flow to the meridians₁. This blocked energy flow is the first step in a chain of events that can develop into an allergic reaction.
    Allergies may manifest itself as a typical runny nose, itching or watering eyes, sneezing, itchy or inflamed skin rash, sinusitis, bronchitis, asthma, arthritis, undiagnosed chronic pain, depression, cravings, addictions, fatigue, insomnia, or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). You may experience allergies or sensitivities to many things — the food you eat, the air you breathe (which carries pollens, fungus, and chemical toxins), radiation, medications, infectious agents (such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and candida) or even other people.
